# Group project: Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
## Data Mining & Machine Learning 2020 - Université de Lausanne
## Group Alpina [AIcrowd]

### 🕵️ Project description

Build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.  

To train the model, we have access to a dataset of 6,471 tweets that were already classified (0 = fake news, 1 = real news).  

### 🚀 Solution

- Import the original dataset
- Train the model on the original dataset without any modification to set the base benchmark accuracy
- Calculate the base rate on the original dataset
- Distribution of the data: 3701 fake new & 2770 real news
- After removing the duplicates: 3676 fake new & 2711 real news
- Preproceesing the text by removing any usless data
- Prediction
